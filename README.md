Else system Display Menu:
1.Ordering: This option allows users to place new orders for products or services. Users typically provide details such as the items they want to order, quantities, and any specific preferences. 
2.Payments: The payments option enables users to complete transactions by making payments for their orders. 
3.Check Balance: This option allows users to inquire about their account balance or available funds. Users may want to check their balance before placing new orders or making payments to ensure they have sufficient funds to cover their transactions. 
4.View Ordering: The view ordering option enables users to review their previous orders and their current status. Users can access details such as order dates, items ordered, quantities, prices, and order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered). This feature facilitates order tracking, helps users recall past purchases, and provides a history of transactions for reference.
99.Back to Menu: This option allows users to return to the main menu or previous menu screen. It provides a way to navigate back to the main menu without completing the current action or transaction. Users may use this option to explore other menu options or correct their selection if they navigate to the wrong menu item.
00.Cancel: The cancel option allows users to abort the current action or transaction and return to the previous state without making any changes. It provides an exit strategy if the user decides to abandon the current operation or if they mistakenly selected an option and want to start over.

This System IT has Also Short Code:
__________________________________

Short Code: In the context of SMS messaging, a short code is a special telephone number, typically shorter than a full phone number, used to send and receive SMS messages. Short codes are often used for various purposes such as marketing campaigns, information services, and interactive messaging applications. In the project, the "short code" feature likely involves handling incoming SMS messages sent to a designated short code number.
Callback: Callbacks are functions or procedures that are passed as arguments to other functions or methods. 
Incoming SMS Handling: This component of the project involves receiving and processing incoming SMS messages sent to the system. 
Combining these components into a single file suggests a modular approach to handling SMS messaging functionality within the project. 
The file likely contains code for:
____________________________________
Setting up and managing callbacks for incoming SMS messages.
Implementing logic to parse and process incoming SMS messages.
Handling responses or triggering actions based on the content of incoming messages.
Potentially integrating with external APIs or services for additional functionality such as sending outgoing messages or performing lookups based on incoming message content.
